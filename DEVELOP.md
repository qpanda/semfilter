Developer Guide
================
## Branching Model
**semfilter** follows the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model. All changes should be made on `feature` branches, `develop` will act as the **stable** branch, and `master` will contain only release versions.

`feature` branches should follow the naming convention `<initials>/<feature>` where `<initials>` is the initials of the developer making the change and `<feature>` is a meaningful short description of the feature. Before changes are merged to `develop` a pull request should be raised and at least one approval should be obtained.

## Git Usage
Git [rebase is preferred over merge](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) and should be used whenever possible. Strive for a clean commit history with [meaningful commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) according to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Versioning
**semfilter** uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## Rust
**semfilter**  is written in Rust. It uses [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) as the build tool and [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) to keep the coding sytle consistent.
